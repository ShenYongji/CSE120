/* Programming Assignment 1: Exercise B
 *
 * Now we will expand the program of Exercise A to call Fork () multiple times.
 * Run the program below and answer the following questions:
 *
 * 1. Can you explain the order of what gets printed based on the code?
 *    	I am the parent, my pid is 1
 *	I just created a child process whose pid is 2
 * 	I (the parent) just created a second child process whose pid is 3
 * 	I am the first child, my pid is 2
 * 	I am the second child, my pid is 3
 * 2. Why do you think the first child executes before the second child?
 *
 * 3. Move the two print statements executed by the parent to just after
 * where it says HERE.  How can you print the pid of the first child?
 * 	Has to have a temporary variable to save the first child.
 *
