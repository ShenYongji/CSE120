# cse_120_pa4_tests

**The author of the test cases is Tianheng Liu.

I disabled the header printing for each test case
and automated the testing process.

If you haven't done so, it's a good time to

BACKUP YOU CODE!

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Copy everything in the folder to pa4 directory.

In your pa4 directory run "./passOrFail.sh"
This will show you whether you pass or fail
each test case.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

To see the details, run "./runAndCompare.sh" in
you pa4 directory. The bash script will automatically 
make the tests, run all of them with your code and 
the provided working funcitons, compare the results,
and display the differences. 

If everything's doing well, the only difference 
displayed for each test case should be the time 
stamps such as:
